# backend

## Development

Install air [cosmtrek/air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) and run `./script/start`

- Frontend Dev server is listening at (localhost:5173)[http://localhost:5173]
- Backend server is listening at (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000]

The frontend proxies the requests for the path `/api/*` to the backend server.
